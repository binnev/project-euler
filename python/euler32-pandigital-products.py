Pandigital products
Problem 32 

We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the 
digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 
through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing 
multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity 
can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only 
include it once in your sum.

""" considering multiplication A * B = C, with len(A) = a, etc. 
The total number of digits must add up to N. 
Number of digits in C is at least as many as the max in A or B:
c >= max(a, b) 
(the limiting case is when either A or B = 1, and then C = the other. In this
case c = max(a, b). c can never be less than max(a, b). )

Therefore, the maximum length of number A (or B) is floor(N/2)
e.g. for N = 11, 
A = 12345, B = 6, C = 74070
Not a valid answer, but the sum of digits is correct.
